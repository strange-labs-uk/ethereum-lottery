# Ethereum HashKeyRaffle Demo

Yet another prototype of a `HashKeyRaffle` DApp which is currently just a renamed fork of [SampleCrowdsale.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/examples/SampleCrowdsale.sol) obtained from the examples shared by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) (an ERC20 token template).

To deploy the `HashKeyRaffle` DApp on a truffle server, do the following:

  git clone https://github.com/strange-labs-uk/ethereum-raffle
  cd ethereum-raffle/truffle
  npm install -g truffle
  npm install
  truffle develop

In the `truffle(develop)>` console:

  deploy --reset

Now you can interact with the raffle contract. Lets send wei to the raffle DApp in exchange for tokens and simultaneous check the total number issued:
  
  raf = HashKeyRaffle.deployed()
  raf.then(i=>i.buyTokens(web3.eth.coinbase,{value:10000,gas:1721975,gasPrice: 1000000})).then(i=>i.logs[1].args)

Check the token balance balance:
  
  tok = raf.token().then(address=>MintableToken.at(address))
  tok.then(instance=>instance.balanceOf(web3.eth.coinbase))

Run draw once the raffle time is up:

  raf.then(i=>i.runDraw()).then(i=>i.logs[0].args)

The best thing to do to ensure that the contract is functioning as expected seems to be to build unit tests into `test/HashKeyRaffle.test.js` and run `test` inside `truffle(develop)>` console.

## Front-end

After you have the truffle contract deployed using the instructions above, now you can use the front-end to interact with functions from the deployed contract using a simple web interface. However, make sure you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) installed on your browser and have added one of the 10 accounts generated by truffle using the respective private key provided.

To serve it:

    cd ethereum-raffle/frontend
    npm install
    npm start

Then browse to http://localhost:3000.

If you make changes to the contract that you want to propagate to the web interface, reset your deployed contract on the `truffle(develop)>` console and refresh the web page:
    
    deploy --reset
