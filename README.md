# Ethereum HashKeyRaffle Demo

This repository is yet another prototype of a raffle DApp which is currently just a renamed fork of [SampleCrowdsale.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/examples/SampleCrowdsale.sol) obtained from the examples shared by [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity) (an ERC20 token template).

    git clone https://github.com/strange-labs-uk/ethereum-raffle

## Truffle

To deploy the `HashKeyRaffle` DApp on a truffle server, do the following:

    npm install -g truffle
    cd ethereum-raffle/truffle
    npm install
    truffle develop

In the `truffle(develop)>` console:

    migrate --reset

The best thing to do to ensure that the contract is functioning as expected seems to be to build unit tests into `test/HashKeyRaffle.test.js` and run `test` inside `truffle(develop)>` console.

## Front-end

After you have the truffle contract deployed using the instructions above, now you can use the front-end to interact with functions from the deployed contract using a simple web interface. However, make sure you have [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) installed on your browser and have added one of the 10 accounts generated by truffle using the respective private key provided.

To serve it:

    cd ethereum-raffle/frontend
    npm install
    npm start

Then browse to http://localhost:3000.
